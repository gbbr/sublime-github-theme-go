Github Theme for Sublime Text 2
===============================

This will make your IDE look exactly like GitHub (if you're a weirdo like that).  
You might also want to do the following in your settings (Cmd+,):

```json
{
	"font_face": "Consolas",
	"font_options":
	[
		"subpixel_antialias"
	],
	"font_size": 12.0,
	"line_padding_bottom": 1.5,
	"line_padding_top": 1.5
}
```
